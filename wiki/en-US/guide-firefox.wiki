= You are ready to go. =
This version of Ease Link is bootstrapped, so no restart is needed^1. And 
Ease link has been fully tweaked for your System. You should be able to 
download Thunder, Flashget, QQ Xuanfeng and FS2you links.

If you want to specify what protocol you want to decode manually, you can 
find options in Add-on manager^2.

_{1, You may need reload the page you opened before installation, to get 
fixing procedure work}
_{2, This requires Firefox 7 and later version, otherwise please upgrade 
your browser, or go to about:config and check out settings starts with 
extension.easelink.*}

= Just click right on the link! =
Unlike 1.0 version, you don't have to click with your right button on the 
link. Those custom protocols are natively supported by your Firefox now, 
and will be decoded to HTTP and FTP links when necessary.

= Use your location bar =
Yes, you may paste a link to location bar to decode it now. I believe it
is useful in some occasion.
